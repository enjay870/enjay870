- 👋 Hi, I’m Nigel Jarvis
- 👀 I’m interested in software and hardware engineering: I was working on STM32F103 using freeRTOS, C and libopencm3
- 🌱 I’m currently learning test-driven development (Java, C/C++) and Haskell and Clash for FPGA, Spartan-6 using ISE
    Webpack and one day I will migrate to version 7 on Vivado but not yet, too much still to learn
- 💞️ I am open to collaborations
- 📫 You can email me here: enjay.contact-me@yahoo.com
